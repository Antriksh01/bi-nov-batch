JS Operators

1. typeof 
    It returns the data type of a variable.

2. Arithmatic Operators
    + plus
    - minus
    * multiplication
    / divide
    ** expontial
    % modulus
    ++ increment (+1)
    -- decrement (-1)

3. Assignment Operators
    = assign a new value to a variable.
    += it will assign a value with increment of 1.
    -= it will assign a value with decrement of 1.
    *= it will multiply with given variable value.
    /= it will divide with given variable value.
    %= it will modulus of no(variable value)
    **= it will expontial with a given value.

4. Comparison Operators
    == checks the two values if they are same or equal.
    === checks the two values as well as their data types.
    != checks the two values if they are not same or equal.
    !== checks the two values as well as their data types are not equal.
    > it checks the greater than number
    >= check the greater than and equal to number.
    < it checks the less than number.
    <= checks the less than and equal to number.

    comparison operators always returns the boolean value.
    if the string can convert into number, it converts automatically.

    Ternary operator
    Syntax:
    condition(can be use comparison operators) ? expression1 : expression2

5. Logical operators
    && AND
        C1  C2  Result
        T   T   T
        F   T   F
        T   F   F
        F   F   F
    || OR
        C1  C2  Result
        T   T   T
        F   T   T
        T   F   T
        F   F   F
    ! NOT
        C   Result
        T   F
        F   T
